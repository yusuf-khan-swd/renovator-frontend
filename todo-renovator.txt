For CommonManageUserTable only return columns not with CommonTable component. Because there is manay useState that needed to pass to CommonManageUserTable if want to make it reusable but we can skip that and only pass data for columns. Only need reusable column for all the manage user pages
We call CommonTable component to page component but get columns from CommonManageUserTable as CommonManageUserColumn

Done - Fix sidebar scroll issue and collapsed arrow icon in dashboard
[solved] to remove collapsed arrow icon pass trigger value null 

Done - Profile page problem. When logout from super_admin profile page and login as user to profile after redirect from login page the super_admin info is showing in /user /profile and /prifle/edit routes. After reloads then it is not showing super_admin info showing user info.
Solve it by
1. not redirect at all
2. redirect to home page not profile page
3. Problem is after redirect to profile page api slice for profile is not call so api is not called after redirected. If we use getSingleUser route with id from getUserInfo() then it perfectly work
4. in server for route add dynmaic route for userProfile /profile/:id to get user profile info. And in ProfilePage component call getUserInfo() function to get userId then pass this userId to useProfileQuery hook from redux api slice.
5. For EditProfilePage pass id from id route params to EditProfilePage as props
[Solved] - in server for route add dynmaic route for userProfile /profile/:id to get user profile info. And in ProfilePage component call getUserInfo() function to get userId then pass this userId to useProfileQuery hook from redux api slice.
